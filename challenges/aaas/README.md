Description:
Give me an e-mail address, I seed random with it. Use that to force a value. We send them an e-mail so that it has some story/value. We could make it seem like spam, but I like AAAS.

Category: misc

Random seeds are not very interesting, but maybe we can make this more compelling.

Why TCP? TCP handshake solves the spoof amplification DoS problem. Because the body is long and SMTP is over TCP for now. I wanted to make this an SMTP client, but I realized that I'd have to reverse. That's still an option.

Solution is solve.py. Read it if you want to understand what's going on.
