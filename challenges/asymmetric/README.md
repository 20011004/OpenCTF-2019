Description:
Simple crypto challenge. Worth very few points, but instructive to those who don't understand AES or RSA.

Category: crypto

Solution: solve.py

Requirements:

How to run:
python3 src/asymmetric1.py >dist/ciphertext.txt
python3 solve.py

NOTE: be damned sure that solve.py solves it. if not, you have a bad ciphertext! I did not have enough energy to fix that bug.

Challenge Text:

RSA and AES are a good combination. You can probably just use an off-the-shelf implementation at this point. All of the weaknesses are when people try to do something clever with them.

Notes:
Reading comprehension and understanding of RSA/AES are useful.
