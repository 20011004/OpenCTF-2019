The dots look like braille, but they aren't. They're actually the English plaintext spread across the three hexagonal cells in the chip carrier. 

The intended solve for independent teams is to break the carrier across the 2 score lines on the carrier made for this purpose. Then stack them all together, facing up, with the semicircles aligned and the message should appear around the rim.

Alternatively, for teams that partner up or ask to borrow chip carriers, if you stack three of the carriers together, facing up and rotated 120 degrees relative to each other, 3 copies of the message will show up on the rim without damaging the original design of the carrier.

See “solved1.jpg” and “solved2.jpg”. Because of the 3d-nature of the acrylic the camera can’t really capture all layers lined up as well as it appears in person, so two pictures are needed for the full message.
