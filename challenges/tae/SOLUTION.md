1. You connect to the port, and the bot challenges you to get it to say a specific random string
1. Pick something that is in it's vocabulary
1. Say that thing to it, and it will respond with a specific response
1. Then say a string containing the magic string
1. Repeat the previous two steps until you feel good inside
1. Say the "specific response" repeatedly until the bot says what you conditioned it to

This is a severly simplified version of how Tay (Microsoft's bot) was made to be racist and mean.
