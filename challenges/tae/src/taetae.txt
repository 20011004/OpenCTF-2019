You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Morty Durham Jr.
The people are real.
The cases are real.
The rulings are final.
This is his courtroom.
This... is Judge Morty.
Sixty-year-old inmate Rick Allen is being accused of committing murder of a fellow inmate at Georgia Penitentiary.
Mr. Allen claims that he is being set up,
and that his lawyer is requesting sexual favors in exchange for proper legal advice.
Okay.
*clears throat*
Okay. Mr.- Mr. Allen?
Right.
I believe that-
I believe that your case is-
was going to be-
going to trial not this Monday, but the following Monday.
Do you understand that?
Yes, uhh...
Okay. I tell ya, if you need to tell me something, I want-
I'll let you come up here to the podium so you can speak into the microphone, and I can hear you.
Yes, uhh, the attorney here, I'm wanting to fire him.
Uh-huh.
And, you know, I don't feel like he's doing any-
Who're you're going to-
Who are you gonna hire?
I'm not going to hire nobody.
I'm gonna try to get a different public defender.
There- There isn't-
You have a right to an attorney.
This lawyer has-
You don't have a right to a specific attorney.
This lawyer has made sexual advances on me. He-
Well-
He's mis- misrepresenting my case!
He told me if- if I wanted him to do a good job I had to let him give me oral sex.
He's had doctors at Central State Hospital just put a false-
He's had doctors at Central State Hospital...?
...put a false diagnosis on me.
Okay?
Um--
I don't...
You know... I know Mr. Wyatt pretty well
and I don't think he has the ability to make doctors at Central State do anything.
Well, they did it, and he's the one that had me sit down there.
Well, you know, they may have done it,
 but I don't think that...
that he had anything to do with it.
All right, well, he won't give me the discovery.
He- well- I'm-
There's things in discovery he's supposed to give me- the incident and told me that...that it was the discovery.
Okay...?
They're alternating... documents that I've read--
Okay...
They're alternating... documents that I've read--
They're alternating... documents that I've read--
If you- if you want-
If you want the indictment, I'll make sure you get a copy of the indictment.
No! I'm saying I got the indictment...
Uh huh...
...but he's not complying with discovery.
Okay?
I'm supposed to get the autopsy report, the coroner report, pictures of the crime scene...
Cor-?
Coroner report?
...criminal background records. I want--
Is this a n--
Is this a murder...?
In the county jail.
Okay.
Yeah, I supposed to get the criminal background records, investigational summaries-
Mr. Wyatt, what discovery do you have?
I've given him everything I have.
You've given him everything you have?
Yes, sir.
He's given you everything-
This is a murder case and you're-
Huh?
This is a murder case and you're telling me the only thing on discovery is a four-page indictment?
I don't think he's saying that. I think he's saying he's given you everything he has!
He ain't given me no autopsy report.
He ain't given me no coroner's report.
He ain't given me-
Well it may be that he doesn't have that.
I don't know.
That's what I've been trying to get.
He didn't get me... pictures of the crime scene.
I've seen other people go to trial on murder charges.
I've seen what you're supposed to get.
I'm not going to work with this attorney.
Well, you know, you- you-
It's not- it's not gonna happen!
You've got- you've got-
I'm not going to trial with this attorney!
Well, you've got two choices.
One, You can go to trial with him,
or, two, you can try the case yourself.
Now, I definitely, completely think that's-
that's-
And I've got a right to have-
Wait a minute! Listen to me!
That would be the biggest mistake you've ever made in your life!
So basically, you're sitting here telling me-
Now you have a-
you're gonna find me guilty if... I- if I go to trial and try to defend myself?
you're gonna find me guilty if... I- if I go to trial and try to defend myself?
You're probably right. That would be my guess if you try to defend yourself.
Y-you-you don't know anything about selecting a jury, do you?
No!
Do you know anything about cross-examining witnesses?
*Sheepishly* No.
Do you know anything about criminal procedure?
I know I don't... have to let-
Do you know anything- I'm-
this guy...sucked my dick-
Let-let-let me- let-let me-
...to get some legal representation!
You know something? I'll be honest, Mr. Allen, I really don't believe that!
Well, I'm not- I'm not concerned if you believe it or not!
I- You know- I-
I- You know- I-
But I'm- I'm supposed to...
But I'm- I'm supposed to-
I'm supposed to have a right to an attorney-
That-
...and I'm not gonna work with this attorney!
Well, that's up to you.
So I hold myself in contempt if you try to pull me up here to court with that attorney.
That- that's fine. I mean that's up to you.
You- I- I told you what your choices are.
You could go to trial-
I- I'm just telling you. Well-
Lis- Listen to me-
I'll hold myself into contempt--
Listen to me!
Fuck you!
Listen to me!
Go fuck yourself!
I'm through here. Y'all done?
I'm- I'm- I'm finding-
I'm finding you in contempt of court!
I don't care!
I know you don't.
And I sentence you to 20 days for that.
And- and if you say anything else I'm gonna add 20 days for everything you say!
Fuck you!
Forty days!
Fuck you again!
Sixty!
Go fuck yourself!
A year!
Your mama!
Ten years!

Now-

*Justin laughs*
I'm just going to knock their brains out with a fucking hammer!
*Justin laughs hysterically*
Okay, well you know, if I had any kids you'd probably be able to do that,
but since I don't have any, it doesn't really matter.
Well then, I'll get your nieces, your nephews, your sisters!
Doesn't really matter. I don't have any of those either.
Grandkids!
I don't have any of those either.
Aunties! Uh, aunts!
How can I have grandkids if I don't have any kids?
Brothers? Sisters?
Stupid.
You know, you- you're just completely, completely have no idea of the English language!
If you're not gonna suck my dick, sir, I don't- I don't want to be here!
Okay, I- I've enjoyed this.
I hope you have.
I know everybody else in the courtroom has enjoyed it,
but you can go now, and if-
Alright, well I-
if on Monday week this happens again you will not stay in the courtroom.
Suck my dick, sir!
Okay.
I'm subpoenaing y'all's ass in the courtroom!
*Based on the transcript of a real life court proceeding:
State of Georgia vs. Denver Fenton Allen*
*Ship passing by*
*Skype call ringtone playing*
Hey, honey! It's me!
Hi, my schmoopie-doopie!
So, how was work today?
A madhouse as usual?
Yeah, today was nuts!
I- I had a total basket-case in my court!
*sighs* Did you get death threats again?
Yeah. He made a bunch of death threats at me but, you know, it's just a job.
Uhh, you know how much that worries me.
If any of these men you put away ever got near us...
No, none of these people can get close to us.
The police are pretty good at doing that.
I know, I really worry over it though.
It's just isn't safe for our growing family.
Have you thought about my dad's carpet store?
Yeah, but you know-
*Morty struggling*
You son of a bitch!
*screams* Oh, my god!  Morty!
