Description:
It behooves me to ask you to return to quineserv. I'm pretty sure you didn't actually take from it what was once Electric Frankenstein's. I believe that they thought themselves better than you in placing two flags in the same challenge. One to make you think that you had won, and the other to mock your lack of skill. For the first will become worthless among the fierce competition of hackers, the second, not so much.

Setup: This relies upon Quineserv running.
