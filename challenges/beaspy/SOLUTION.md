We have a lot of flags on our side of the table. They are protected mainly by angle. How difficult would it be for someone to just get one?

We may find out by giving 100 points to someone who just finds this flag.

At a certain position you can see the post-it note. It is very long, so you'll need to write it down in pieces.

Flag: flag{easy1_gdb2_Music_F71_TTGYG_M68HC11_minishell_unic0de}

This involved looking on the table at the conference. You will no longer be able to solve this since it was necesary to be there to do so.
