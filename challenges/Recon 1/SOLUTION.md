This is probably not solveable anymore because the lookback window is not infinite.

1. The challenge just says "On the twentieth day of July an interesting fact was shared at the sibling of Antipodes. Between the subtle shading of green and blue, from the frog to the smurf."
2. Searching for "Between the subtle shading" points you to kryptos which is a sclupture made by Jim Sanborn
3. Antipodes is a sculpture also made by Jim Snaborn, although there are lots of results for Antipodes
4. Green and blue, from the frog to the smurf. Is a very obvious reference to Ingress, which if you go to intel.ingress.com you can reed chat messages based on the location
5. If you zoom in on Kryptos's location and scroll up to July 20 you will find HackthePlanetZmxhZ3tZUVRRVVhRQlFWWVVWTExUUkVWSllRVE1LWVJETUZEVkZQSlVERUVIWldFVFpZVkdXSEtLUUVUR0ZRSk59
    You can actually just type "Kryptos" into the intel maps search function.
6. If you base64 decode ZmxhZ3tZUVRRVVhRQlFWWVVWTExUUkVWSllRVE1LWVJETUZEVkZQSlVERUVIWldFVFpZVkdXSEtLUUVUR0ZRSk59 you get flag{YQTQUXQBQVYUVLLTREVJYQTMKYRDMFDVFPJUDEEHZWETZYVGWHKKQETGFQJN}
