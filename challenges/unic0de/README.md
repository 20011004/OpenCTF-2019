Description: This appears to be another malicious service. Can you try to take it offline or at least fix it? This service runs on UDP.

Category: pwnable

## Notes

Give me invalid utf-8 that is also invalid utf-16.

I am teaching people to understand what the fuck encoding means.

Why UDP? Because we are too smart to use TCP or HTTP.

Solution is solve.py
